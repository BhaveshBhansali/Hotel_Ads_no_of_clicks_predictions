    "## In this notebook. I have tried different parametric and non-parametric models to predict number of clicks based on characterstics of hotels. I have added some additional features for better predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Feature Engineering: I have added following features\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Number of Hotels (n_hotels): Number of hotels affect the chances of clicking on hotel offers (More choices of offers then number of clicks distributes between those offers)\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Promotion: If price of hotel compared to hotels of same category ('stars') within same cities is less, tha flag promotion as 1 and vice versa\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - Hotel Popularity (hotel popularity from comparable number of reviews): ratio of number_of_reviews(n_reviews)/avg(n_reviews) from hotels of same category ('stars') within same cities.\n",
    "     \n",
    "2. Scaling of features: Since I did not have idea which features should be given more weightage, I have scaled the features so that no feature should dominate other feature (when underlying model use some kind of euclidean distance). However, I also used scaled features in tree based models which do not require scaled features. Nevertheless, algorithm converges faster.\n",

    "         - High Multicollinearity: Independent variables are highly positive correlated \n",
    "         - High variance of residuals: varaince of residuals changes with fitted line\n",
    "         - Non-Normality of residuals: Might be due to outliers\n",

    "- Since 65% of rows have 'n_clicks' values to be 0. We can 2 models in following way:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Build a \"classification model\" which classifies rows as a 0 clicks or non zero clicks (lablel each row as 0 or non zero)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - The rows which classification model classifies as non-zero clicks, build a \"regression model\" on those data to predict n_clicks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- I have not used 'city_id' as of now directly in the set of features. However, we can learn embedding for the city_id's. In this way, cities with similar \"hotel characterstics\" will be near in feature space (similar embeddings). For example, cities with similar kind of hotels (stars) and good ratings are near in the embedding space. We could use this as one of the feature. This could be done using neural network (simple multi layer perceptron model).\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Some sampling techniques or weighting technique could be used to balance the dataset (zero and non-zero n_clicks) so that model is not biased to n_clicks=0.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Some more features could be thought on by understanding more business domain.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- As of now, I have just used simple technique to remove \"outliers\" without business knowledge. Some other techniques like z-score (parametric model could be applied which says how many standard deviations a data point is from the sample’s mean).  \n",
